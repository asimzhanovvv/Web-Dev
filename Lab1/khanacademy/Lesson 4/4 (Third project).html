        <p class="post">
        This is the beginning of my journey into programming. I decided to learn how computers work and how to write code. At first, many things seemed confusing and difficult, but I understood that this is a normal part of learning.<br><br>I started with basic concepts and simple tasks. Every small success made me more confident and motivated. Even when I made mistakes, I learned something new from them.

        <p class="post">This week I started learning HTML and CSS. HTML helps to create the structure of a website, while CSS is used to style it and make it look better.<br><br>I learned how to work with headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. I also tried changing colors, fonts, and spacing. Creating my first simple webpage was exciting and made me want to continue learning web development.</p>
