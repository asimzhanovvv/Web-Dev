1) Create a script that prompts the visitor to enter two numbers and then shows their sum.

    Answer: 
    let a = +prompt("The first number?", "");
    let b = +prompt("The second number?", "");

    alert( a + b );

2) Create a function readNumber which prompts for a number until the visitor enters a valid numeric value.
   The resulting value must be returned as a number.
   The visitor can also stop the process by entering an empty line or pressing “CANCEL”. In that case, the function should return null.

   Answer:
   function readNumber() {
     let num;
   
     do {
       num = prompt("Enter a number please?", 0);
     } while ( !isFinite(num) );
   
     if (num === null || num === '') return null;
   
     return +num;
   }
   
   alert(`Read: ${readNumber()}`);

3) This loop is infinite. It never ends. Why?
   let i = 0;
   while (i != 10) {
     i += 0.2;
   }

   Answer: Because i would never equal 10.

4) The built-in function Math.random() creates a random value from 0 to 1 (not including 1).
   Write the function random(min, max) to generate a random floating-point number from min to max (not including max).


   Answer:

   function random(min, max) {
     return min + Math.random() * (max - min);
   }
   
   alert( random(1, 5) );
   alert( random(1, 5) );
   alert( random(1, 5) );
